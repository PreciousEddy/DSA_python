## Declaration/Initializations

  Remember values, not variables, have data types.

  A variable can be reassigned to contain a different data type.

 > answer = 42<br>
 > answer = "The answer is 42."


## Data Types

 >**boolean = True**<br>

 > number = 1.1<br>

 > string = " Strings can be declared with single or double quotes."<br>

 > list = ["Lists can have", 1, 2, 3, 4, "or more types together!"]<br>

 > tuple = ("Tuples", "can have", "more than", 2, "elements!") <br>

 > dictionary = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}<br>

 > variable_with_zero_data = None<br>
